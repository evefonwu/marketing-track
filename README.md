### How I'm Approaching the Tasks

The way I am approaching the tasks is to break it into several parts.

- First, I study the provided Figma design. Then I outline the HTML structure from outer containers in. I use the GFE provided Figma plugin to get most of the styles in CSS that I will modify and add styles to.
- In the second part, I get into styling the nested elements within the containers.
- Then, I check the style guide for typography and different button and link states and add these in.

### Implementing Responsive Design

- Tip: Read the GFE provided guides on grid layout. Don't follow the Figma plugin code too closely for related layouts when using CSS grid because the plugin converts it to CSS with flexbox layout mode.

- Responsive Hero Section: This task required implementing responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop views. I used CSS grid, grid rows and columns for the page layout, media queries for the three main breakpoints, and Flexbox for item alignments.

### Client-side Interactivity

- For the same buttons and links as previous tasks, I extracted the button and link styles into reusable React components: a Button component, and a Call-to-action Link component.

- Interactive FAQ Section: For this task, I opted in to React Client Components in Next.js in order to use useState and modify the list of accordion items to implement core accordion functionality.
