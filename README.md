### How I'm Approaching the Tasks

The way I am approaching the tasks is to break it into several parts.

- First, I study the provided Figma design. Then I outline the HTML structure from outer containers in. I use the GFE provided Figma plugin to get most of the styles in CSS that I will modify and add styles to.
- In the second part, I get into styling the nested elements within the containers.
- Then, I check the style guide for typography and different button and link states and add these in.
